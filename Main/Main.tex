\begin{abstract}
   This report presents the methodology applied to improve the performance of a transmission network affected by several difficulties. The main purposes of the study have been the increase in the security of supply and the design of a more resilient electrical system to decrease the dependence on interconnection points to external transport networks. Several contingency analyses have been run to achieve these final goals. The project has been divided into four different phases, each step leading to a relative improvement. In the 1st phase, a study of the current system has been performed, leading to the development of the 2nd phase, which has added several transmission lines to improve the security of supply between generation and demand. Four lines were added to meet the N-1 criteria. The 3rd phase has consisted of the addition of two new renewable energy power plants to the electrical system. It resulted that minimum two lines were added. The 4th phase has considered the installation of a storage unit, which did not improve considerably the results, and the restoration of a dismantled gas plant, which required only the installation of one additional line. Finally, a Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) has been elaborated to close the project. By simulating several configurations of the transmission network, this study has reached the optimal structure of the system in economic and performance terms. With the new configuration, a more resilient, secure and environmentally friendly electrical system has been achieved, which completely matches the main objectives of smart grids.
