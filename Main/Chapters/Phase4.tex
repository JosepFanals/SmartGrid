While the previous phase included renewables to mitigate the technical problems, another possibility has to do with installing storage systems, rehabilitating a dismantled plant, among others. Certainly, renewables have not been enough to solve the issue of requiring a stronger interconnection. The same number of added lines have been needed in order to meet the $N-1$ criteria. Hence, it is convenient to evaluate if other elements are capable of improving the energetic independence of the system under study, and at the same time, if it becomes economically appealing.

This chapter is structured in the following manner. First, we detail the characteristics of the storage unit, its operation mode and the expected impact on the system. Then, the dismantled plant is evaluated. Focus is placed on its potential environmental impact rather than on its technical aspects. Once these elements have been defined, results are extracted by running the simulation, including the contingency analysis.

Just as an overview, Figure \ref{fig:netstorage} displays the system with the new elements under consideration.

\section{Storage}
% talk about the storage unit, the P profile we have decided, the technology like Liion, a bit about costs..

\section{Dismantled plant}
% mainly discuss carbon emissions of gas, coal... some equations and numbers to estimate, some references

\section{Base case results}
% such as in the net picture, compare with previous results (table with 3 columns, 1 for each case)

\section{Contingency analysis}
% similar as before



% put somewhere like a pie chart of the energy provided by each source... in this chapter we should place to focus on the emissions, it would make the project more complete
